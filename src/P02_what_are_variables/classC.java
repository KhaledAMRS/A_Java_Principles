// What's variables, Type of variables, how to define variables
// Variables are the names you give to computer memory locations which are used to store values in a computer program.

    /*
Type of variables
  int num = 5;
  char a = 'z';
  String x = "text";
  boolean type = true;      // or false
  double y = 1.523245345;

- Notes:
    * S should be capital when defining String unlike other variables like int, char, boolean, double
    * if the variable is String then value should be written between ""
      but if the variable is char then value should be ''
      and for other variables the values are written without "" or ''
    * Don't forget ; at the end of any variable

    types of Access_Modifiers available for variables

     1- Default: will be available for any other class in the same package but not available for other packages  >> use import to explain this
     2- public: declared public can be accessed from any other class.

     there might be other Access_Modifiers for variables but that's enough for now
     what's static?      we will talk about it after objects
